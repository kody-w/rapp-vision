Reproduce: use the mirrored split as two lawful societies of equal weight, then place the refused tyrant claim on the shared inner edge.
Scene 1 (0.0–2.8s): “Law is executable history” reveals above the real constitution ledger; a blue section rule self-draws (`svg-path-draw`) into the split.
Scene 2 (2.8–6.0s): on “Two societies can fork lawfully,” two real branch crops enter from opposite sides with restrained mirrored book-open tilts (`split-tilt-cards`) and settle equally.
Scene 3 (6.0–8.6s): as the tyrant is named, the refused frame appears on the inner seam; `LAW-TREASURY-1` flips to `LAW-TREASURY-2` in place (`discrete-text-sequence`) while replay refusal remains visible.
Scene 4 (8.6–9.493s): hold the two lawful branches and the rejected central claim; no camera motion.

narrativeRole: Show governance as replayable constraints rather than prose attached after the fact.
keyMessage: Authority is accepted only when the active law permits it.

## Selected blueprint: comparison-split

# comparison-split — Comparison Split-Cards

**intent**: Two paired items of equal weight shown side-by-side with mirrored 3D "book-open" tilts — the eye reads them as a balanced comparison, then a pill badge lands at each card's inner edge to punctuate. The motion IS the symmetry: two cards arriving from opposite wings into a held spread.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from `comparison-split-cards`): when two complementary features / capabilities of equal weight should be presented **simultaneously, not sequentially** — an A/B, a "X + Y together," paired concepts the viewer must weigh side-by-side. Not for >2 items (use `grid-card-assemble`) or sequential steps.

**duration**: 4–6s

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas carrying two faint ambient glow blooms — `[accent A]` near 30%, `[accent B]` near 70% — so each side owns a color identity across a 50% symmetry axis; equal-width cards under one shared perspective parent)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~0.8s) — title sets the concept.** A centered `[title line]` with an `[accent keyword]` slides DOWN into place from just above (a short smooth settle). The downward arrival is deliberate: it forms a non-conflicting T-shape against the cards, which arrive from the sides next.
- **Scene 2 (~0.4–1.9s) — the split-tilt entry (signature move).** Two equal-width feature cards arrive from opposite wings — `[left card]` from the left, `[right card]` from the right ~0.2s behind — each carrying a **mirrored 3D `rotateY` tilt** (left faces right, right faces left, opening like a book) and scaling ~0.85→1 as it lands. The entry overlaps the title's tail so the whole thing reads as ONE arrival, not two beats. Each card holds `[image / label / subtitle]`; box-shadows fall **outward** from the tilt (left shadow right, right shadow left).
- **Scene 3 (~1.9–end) — badges punctuate, then hold.** A pill `[badge]` lands at each card's **inner edge** (left then right, ~0.3s apart), overlapping its card ~15% so it reads as attached, not orbiting. This is the lone overshoot in the shot — it earns the punctuation. Settles and holds.

**motion vocabulary**: title slide-down from above; mirrored opposite-wing card entry; static book-open `rotateY` tilt (`+tilt` left, `−tilt` right); tilt-matched outward box-shadow; inner-edge badge spring-pop; gentle phase-opposed idle float (left vs right, never synchronized) registered as subtle jitter; dual side-glow ambient.

**rule mapping**

- two cards entering from opposite wings with mirrored `rotateY` tilts + tilt-matched shadow → `split-tilt-cards` (the signature; keep the two-layer split so the entry `x`/`scale` and the idle never collide on one alias)
- title slide-down settle → `gsap-effects` (translate + opacity on a long-tail `power3`)
- inner-edge pill badge pop (the one overshoot) → `spring-pop-entrance` (overshoot register — earns the punctuation)
- phase-opposed idle float on the pair → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter, NOT lazy breathing; left `sin(t)`, right `sin(t+π)` so they never conveyor-belt)
- the two faint side glows behind the cards → `ambient-glow-bloom` (un-triggered soft bloom, one per accent)

**camera modifier**: camera-static by default — the symmetry is the subject and a move would break the balance.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# Split Tilt Cards

Two cards side-by-side with opposing `rotateY` (left `+TILT`, right `−TILT`) — a symmetric "book-open" 3D split for comparisons, before/after, feature pairs. Each card slides in from its own side (reinforcing "they came from their own worlds and met here"), then the pair idles in counter-phase.

## How It Works

`perspective` on the scene root (REQUIRED — without it `rotateY` flattens to a 2D layout) and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the stage and both cards. Entry starts each card off-axis with `TILT + TILT_OVERSHOOT`, settling to `TILT` — a pivot-into-place. Idle is a gentle counter-phase y-bob (the two yoyo tweens run in opposite directions); copy fades up during the cards' settle, not after.

## Recipe

<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="split-stage">
  <div class="card card-left">
    <div class="card-eyebrow">{leftEyebrow}</div>

  </div>
  <div class="card card-right">…</div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene-root {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  perspective: SCENE_PERSPECTIVE; /* REQUIRED */
}
.split-stage {
  display: flex;
  gap: STAGE_GAP;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}
.card {
  width: CARD_WIDTH;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;

}
/* Shadow falls WITH the facing direction: left card faces right → shadow right. */
.card-left {
  box-shadow: -CARD_SHADOW_OFFSET CARD_SHADOW_DROP CARD_SHADOW_BLUR {shadowColor};
}
.card-right {
  box-shadow: CARD_SHADOW_OFFSET CARD_SHADOW_DROP CARD_SHADOW_BLUR {shadowColor};
}
```

```js
// Entry — from outside, opposing tilts settle with a small pivot
tl.fromTo(
  ".card-left",
  { x: -ENTRY_SLIDE_DIST, rotateY: TILT + TILT_OVERSHOOT, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, rotateY: TILT, opacity: 1, duration: ENTRY_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  LEFT_AT,
);
tl.fromTo(
  ".card-right",
  { x: ENTRY_SLIDE_DIST, rotateY: -TILT - TILT_OVERSHOOT, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, rotateY: -TILT, opacity: 1, duration: ENTRY_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  RIGHT_AT,
);

// Counter-phase idle bob — opposite signs = alive; synchronized = conveyor belt
tl.to(
  ".card-left",
  { y: -FLOAT_AMP, duration: FLOAT_DURATION / 2, ease: "sine.inOut", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  IDLE_START,
);
tl.to(
  ".card-right",
  { y: FLOAT_AMP, duration: FLOAT_DURATION / 2, ease: "sine.inOut", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  IDLE_START,
);

// Copy fades up during the settle
tl.from(
  ".card-eyebrow, .card-headline, .card-body",
  { opacity: 0, y: COPY_RISE, stagger: COPY_STAGGER, duration: COPY_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  COPY_REVEAL_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Badges / floating labels**: position them on the PARENT, never inside a card — inside they inherit the `rotateY` and tilt off-axis.
- **3+ cards**: center card stays flat (`rotateY: 0`), outer two tilt inward — "old way / nothing / our way."
- **Zoom-through**: a separate camera tween scaling `.split-stage` reads as the viewer crossing the gap between the tilted pair.

| FLOAT_DURATION    | 1.6–3.2s round trip              | breathing cadence; IDLE_START ≥ entry end               |
| COPY_REVEAL_AT    | during the entry tail            | copy popping in after cards are idle reads disconnected |

## Critical Constraints

- **`perspective` on the scene root is REQUIRED**; `preserve-3d` on the stage AND each card.
- **Shadow direction matches tilt** — left card faces right → shadow falls right (and mirrored). Wrong sign reads as broken 3D.
- **Counter-phase idle** — the two bobs run with opposite signs at the same position.
- **Badges outside the card divs** (they'd inherit the rotation).
- **Body copy ≤ 2 lines per card** — tilted long paragraphs collapse into perspective blur.
- **Symmetric weight** — same width, same vertical center, similar line counts; asymmetry breaks the comparison metaphor.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
