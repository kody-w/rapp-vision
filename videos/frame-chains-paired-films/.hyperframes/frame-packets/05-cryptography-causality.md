## Frame 5 — Cryptography is not causality

- scene: The accepted accusation remains visible while the forged clue and red semantic oracle take over the frame.
- voiceover: "The detective accepts only a theory backed by exact earlier causes. Forge one plausible clue, and cryptography stays green while causality turns red."
- duration: 10.752s

- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/05-cryptography-causality.html
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: Negative contrast

- asset_candidates: assets/proof-clips/05-causal-detective/source.webm — real supported accusation and semantic-oracle rejection
- focal: assets/proof-clips/05-causal-detective/source.webm
- roles: source.webm = background proof footage
- sfx: click-soft, glitch-2, error

Adapt: keep the proof-footage pivot, using the accepted accusation as the stable anchor and the forged clue as the semantic contrast.
Scene 1 (0.0–3.1s): open on the real accepted accusation receipt, framed right; “Exact earlier causes” builds left via per-word reveal (`dynamic-content-sequencing`), with no red verdict yet.
Scene 2 (3.1–6.6s): as “Forge one plausible clue” is spoken, the footage cuts to F01 and a brief deterministic chromatic snap (`chromatic-glitch`) identifies the forged row before resolving clean.
Scene 3 (6.6–9.5s): on “cryptography stays green while causality turns red,” pivot to a split proof lockup: `HASH ✓` left and `CAUSE ✕` right, arriving as mirrored cards (`split-tilt-cards`) beside the real red oracle.
Scene 4 (9.5–10.752s): the accepted accusation remains visible under the rejection; both hold still to prove failure isolation.

narrativeRole: Make the difference between hash validity and world validity unforgettable.
keyMessage: A plausible, correctly hashed event can still be impossible.

## Selected blueprint: video-text-pivot

# video-text-pivot — Video → Text Pivot

**intent**: A product video holds center and claims attention, then slides aside to hand its weight to a hero stat in the space it vacates, then both clear and kinetic text types into the center — accent words carrying the meaning the video used to carry — sealed by a gradient pill. The arc is "show → yield → pivot → stamp," and each handoff pairs an exit with a same-anchor entrance so two beats read, not four.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from `metric-video-text-pivot`): when the open is "see the feature" then "see the impact" and the `[product video]` must stay visible through the stat reveal — it slides, it doesn't cut.
- Key_Feature: a feature clip that yields to a frame-filling metric and a typographic impact line.

**duration**: 6–8s

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; one `[product video]` as a real muted `.mp4` clip, a hero stat, then kinetic text — each pair shares a screen anchor so the handoff reads as a weight-transfer)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.6s) — the video shows.** The `[product video]` lands centered on a smooth scale-up and breathes (a small y-bob), claiming full attention. Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.6–3.2s) — yield + stat (signature move).** The video SLIDES aside (x + scale down) **into the very space** the `[hero stat]` now fills as the stat pops in with 3D-depth type — one weight-transfer reading as a single event, not two. The stat breathes within this window.
- **Scene 3 (~3.2–5.0s) — pivot to text.** Both video and stat clear out and kinetic `[impact text]` TYPES into the vacated center, character by character; its `[accent words]` carry the meaning the video used to carry.
- **Scene 4 (~5.0–end) — stamp.** A gradient `[pill]` snaps shut around the closing line (`scaleX` 0→1), its glow halo resolving a beat behind so the silhouette reads before the bloom — sealing the statement as one graphic. Holds.

**motion vocabulary**: video scale-in + small breath; weight-transfer slide (video x + scale-down handing off to the stat at the same anchor); 3D-depth stat type; character-stream typing; gradient pill scaleX-snap; glow-halo bloom trailing the silhouette.

**rule mapping**

- video entrance (smooth) and the weight-transfer slide → `gsap-effects` (scale/opacity then x + scale on a long-tail `power3`); the video itself is a muted `<video class="clip">` direct child of the root
- hero stat's frame-filling 3D type → `3d-text-depth-layers` (static-depth variation — layers built at setup, no cascade fighting the entry)
- the same-anchor video-exit ↔ stat-entry handoff (if treated as a morph) → `scale-swap-transition` (shared center)
- character-by-character impact typing through segmented spans → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (clean character stream) or `discrete-text-sequence`
- pill `scaleX` snap + trailing glow halo → `gsap-effects` (scaleX) + `ambient-glow-bloom` (the halo, resolving a beat behind)
- video / stat breath within their windows → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter, gated to each element's window, never a forever loop)

**camera modifier**: camera-static — all motion is element-space (the video translates), so the "pivot" is the elements moving, not a camera.

# Chromatic Glitch

Digital interference as punctuation: for a fraction of a second the element **breaks** — offset color copies shudder behind it, or horizontal slices displace sideways — then it **snaps sharp** and holds clean. The payoff is the resolve; the glitch exists to make the clean state land harder. Two forms: an **RGB-split jitter** (warm + cool ghost copies vibrating behind the base) and a **slice displacement** (horizontal bands that arrive offset and converge).

Boundaries: [motion-blur-streak.md](motion-blur-streak.md) is velocity blur tied to **travel** — its element is going somewhere fast. A glitching element is **in place**; the disturbance is temporal, not directional. [hacker-flip-3d.md](hacker-flip-3d.md) substitutes **glyphs** (a decode); here the glyphs are fixed and only displaced copies of them move.

## How It Works

The subject is stacked: the **base copy on top** (full legibility at every frame), ghost copies behind. All motion comes from one finite **amplitude-envelope** tween read by an `onUpdate`:

1. **Quantized time** — `const step = Math.floor(tl.time() / JITTER_STEP)`. The stutter comes from offsets that hold for `JITTER_STEP` and then jump. Smoothly interpolated offsets read as wobble, not glitch — **the quantization IS the digital texture**.
2. **Deterministic hash** — offsets are a pure function of `(step, layerIndex)`:

   ```js
   const glitchHash = (n) => {
     const x = Math.sin(n * 127.1 + 311.7) * 43758.5453;
     return x - Math.floor(x); // 0..1, pure — a scrub to any t recomputes the same frame
   };
   ```

3. **Amplitude envelope** — a proxy tween carries `amp: 1 → 0` over `GLITCH_DUR`. Per-frame offset = `amp × (glitchHash(step * 13 + layer * 7) * 2 − 1) × MAX_SPLIT`. When the envelope hits zero the copies sit at exactly 0 — the snap-sharp is built into the math, and a final `tl.set` clamps the rest state so the hold is bit-exact.

The **slice form** swaps color copies for `SLICE_COUNT` full copies, each clipped to a horizontal band via `clip-path: inset()`; per-band `x` (and optional `scaleX` stretch) start at hash-derived offsets and converge to 0 under a stepped ease.

```

```js
// Form A: RGB-split jitter — envelope snaps to full amplitude, decays to zero.
// All per-frame state derives from tl.time() + the envelope: pure, replays on seek.
const copies = gsap.utils.toArray("#glitch-stack .glitch-copy");
const amp = { a: 0 };
tl.set(amp, { a: 1 }, GLITCH_START);
tl.set(copies, { opacity: SPLIT_OPACITY }, GLITCH_START);
tl.to(
  amp,
  {
    a: 0,
    duration: GLITCH_DUR,
    ease: "power3.in", // most of the violence up front, dying fast
    onUpdate: () => {
      const step = Math.floor(tl.time() / JITTER_STEP); // quantized — the stutter
      copies.forEach((el, layer) => {
        const jx = (glitchHash(step * 13 + layer * 7) * 2 - 1) * MAX_SPLIT * amp.a;
        const jy = (glitchHash(step * 29 + layer * 11) * 2 - 1) * MAX_SPLIT * 0.35 * amp.a;
        gsap.set(el, { x: jx, y: jy });
      });
    },
  },
  GLITCH_START,
);
// The clean resolve: clamp ghosts to exact rest — never rely on the decay
// landing on zero. A ghost left 1px off reads as a bug every frame after.
tl.set(copies, { x: 0, y: 0, opacity: 0 }, GLITCH_START + GLITCH_DUR);

// Form B: slice displacement — N band copies of the same content converge.
const slices = gsap.utils.toArray("#slice-stack .slice");
const bandH = 100 / slices.length;
slices.forEach((el, i) => {
  gsap.set(el, { clipPath: `inset(${i * bandH}% 0 ${100 - (i + 1) * bandH}% 0)` });
  const dir = glitchHash(i * 3 + 1) > 0.5 ? 1 : -1;
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    {
      x: dir * (SLICE_OFFSET_MIN + glitchHash(i * 5 + 2) * (SLICE_OFFSET_MAX - SLICE_OFFSET_MIN)),
      scaleX: 1 + glitchHash(i * 7 + 3) * SLICE_STRETCH,
      opacity: 1,
    },
    { x: 0, scaleX: 1, duration: SLICE_RESOLVE_DUR, ease: "steps(SLICE_STEPS)" },
    SLICE_START + glitchHash(i * 11 + 4) * SLICE_JITTER_LAG,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Glitch-stretch entrance** — the element ENTERS glitching: layer `fromTo(stack, { scaleX: STRETCH_FROM, opacity: 0 }, { scaleX: 1, opacity: 1, duration: GLITCH_DUR, ease: "power4.out" })` (`STRETCH_FROM` 1.3–1.8) on the whole stack while the envelope runs. Stretch, split, and envelope all die at the same frame — the word is simply _there_, sharp.
- **Emphasis burst on a held word** — a spasm, not an arrival: 2–3 short envelopes (`GLITCH_DUR` ~0.12–0.2s each) separated by clean gaps of ~0.2–0.4s, each its own `set(amp)/to(amp)/set(rest)` triplet. The clean frames between bursts make it read as energy instead of a rendering fault.
- **Slice reveal** — Form B as the arrival itself: bands start opaque but displaced, converge under the stepped ease. Drop the color copies for the monochrome version — the restrained enterprise read of this rule.
- **Card / non-text glitch** — the stacked-copy machinery is content-agnostic (logo lockup, small card). Keep `MAX_SPLIT` proportional (~1% of element width) — oversized splits read as broken layout, not interference.

## Critical Constraints

- **Quantize time — the stutter IS the effect.** Offsets hold for `JITTER_STEP` then jump; if the glitch looks like jelly, you interpolated. `JITTER_STEP` ≥ one render frame or the quantization silently disappears.
- **Pure functions of (quantized time, index)** — every per-frame value comes from `glitchHash`; the hash inputs use `tl.time()`, nothing else.
- **Clamp the rest state** — `tl.set({ x: 0, y: 0, opacity: 0 })` on the ghosts at envelope end; never rely on the decay landing exactly on zero.
- **Base on top, always legible** — ghosts vibrate _behind_ the base; a glitch that destroys legibility for more than ~2 frames is a tear-down, not an accent.
- **Brief, then clean** — the clean hold after the snap is the actual beat; `GLITCH_DUR` well under half the element's screen time. Emphasis bursts are separate finite triplets.
- **No CSS `@keyframes` glitch loops** — the classic CSS glitch snippet runs on the wall clock and desyncs from seek; every displacement goes through the timeline's `onUpdate`.
- **Match the register** — RGB-split is a loud consumer/tech gesture; the monochrome slice variant is the only form that belongs in a restrained enterprise composition.

description: Auto-calculate timeline start/end times from content length + per-item duration config — longer content gets more screen time without hardcoded numbers.
metadata:

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

| CONTENT N     | 3–6 entries           | <3 isn't a sequence; >6 drags (accelerating cadence relaxes this — see above)                                         |

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Split Tilt Cards

Two cards side-by-side with opposing `rotateY` (left `+TILT`, right `−TILT`) — a symmetric "book-open" 3D split for comparisons, before/after, feature pairs. Each card slides in from its own side (reinforcing "they came from their own worlds and met here"), then the pair idles in counter-phase.

## How It Works

`perspective` on the scene root (REQUIRED — without it `rotateY` flattens to a 2D layout) and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the stage and both cards. Entry starts each card off-axis with `TILT + TILT_OVERSHOOT`, settling to `TILT` — a pivot-into-place. Idle is a gentle counter-phase y-bob (the two yoyo tweens run in opposite directions); copy fades up during the cards' settle, not after.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="split-stage">
  <div class="card card-left">
    <div class="card-eyebrow">{leftEyebrow}</div>
    <div class="card-headline">{leftHeadline}</div>
    <div class="card-body">{leftBody}</div>
  </div>
  <div class="card card-right">…</div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene-root {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  perspective: SCENE_PERSPECTIVE; /* REQUIRED */
}
.split-stage {
  display: flex;
  gap: STAGE_GAP;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}
.card {
  width: CARD_WIDTH;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  will-change: transform;
}
/* Shadow falls WITH the facing direction: left card faces right → shadow right. */
.card-left {
  box-shadow: -CARD_SHADOW_OFFSET CARD_SHADOW_DROP CARD_SHADOW_BLUR {shadowColor};
}
.card-right {
  box-shadow: CARD_SHADOW_OFFSET CARD_SHADOW_DROP CARD_SHADOW_BLUR {shadowColor};
}
```

```js
// Entry — from outside, opposing tilts settle with a small pivot
tl.fromTo(
  ".card-left",
  { x: -ENTRY_SLIDE_DIST, rotateY: TILT + TILT_OVERSHOOT, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, rotateY: TILT, opacity: 1, duration: ENTRY_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  LEFT_AT,
);
tl.fromTo(
  ".card-right",
  { x: ENTRY_SLIDE_DIST, rotateY: -TILT - TILT_OVERSHOOT, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, rotateY: -TILT, opacity: 1, duration: ENTRY_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  RIGHT_AT,
);

// Counter-phase idle bob — opposite signs = alive; synchronized = conveyor belt
tl.to(
  ".card-left",
  { y: -FLOAT_AMP, duration: FLOAT_DURATION / 2, ease: "sine.inOut", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  IDLE_START,
);
tl.to(
  ".card-right",
  { y: FLOAT_AMP, duration: FLOAT_DURATION / 2, ease: "sine.inOut", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  IDLE_START,
);

// Copy fades up during the settle
tl.from(
  ".card-eyebrow, .card-headline, .card-body",
  { opacity: 0, y: COPY_RISE, stagger: COPY_STAGGER, duration: COPY_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  COPY_REVEAL_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Badges / floating labels**: position them on the PARENT, never inside a card — inside they inherit the `rotateY` and tilt off-axis.
- **3+ cards**: center card stays flat (`rotateY: 0`), outer two tilt inward — "old way / nothing / our way."
- **Zoom-through**: a separate camera tween scaling `.split-stage` reads as the viewer crossing the gap between the tilted pair.

## Values

| token             | range                            | notes                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| SCENE_PERSPECTIVE | 1000–2400px                      | lower exaggerates the tilt; higher reads near-isometric |
| TILT              | 10–18°                           | < 10 reads almost flat; > 18 folds shut and copy blurs  |
| TILT_OVERSHOOT    | 4–12°                            | the pivot-into-place feel                               |
| STAGE_GAP         | 40–120px (~0.06–0.15×CARD_WIDTH) | small = fused pair; large = compared-but-separate       |
| CARD_WIDTH        | 480–820px @1920                  | `2×CARD_WIDTH + STAGE_GAP ≤ 0.95×stage` at full tilt    |
| ENTRY_SLIDE_DIST  | 200–500px (~0.3–0.6×CARD_WIDTH)  |                                                         |
| ENTRY_DUR         | 0.6–1.2s                         |                                                         |
| RIGHT_AT          | LEFT_AT + 0–0.3s                 | zero feels mechanical; large fragments the pair         |
| FLOAT_AMP         | 3–8px                            | subtle is the point                                     |
| FLOAT_DURATION    | 1.6–3.2s round trip              | breathing cadence; IDLE_START ≥ entry end               |
| COPY_REVEAL_AT    | during the entry tail            | copy popping in after cards are idle reads disconnected |

## Critical Constraints

- **`perspective` on the scene root is REQUIRED**; `preserve-3d` on the stage AND each card.
- **Shadow direction matches tilt** — left card faces right → shadow falls right (and mirrored). Wrong sign reads as broken 3D.
- **Counter-phase idle** — the two bobs run with opposite signs at the same position.
- **Badges outside the card divs** (they'd inherit the rotation).
- **Body copy ≤ 2 lines per card** — tilted long paragraphs collapse into perspective blur.
- **Symmetric weight** — same width, same vertical center, similar line counts; asymmetry breaks the comparison metaphor.
