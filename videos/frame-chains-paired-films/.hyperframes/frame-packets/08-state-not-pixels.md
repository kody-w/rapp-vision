Adapt: keep the action roundtrip through one continuous world—Device A to Device B to two provenance receipts.
Scene 1 (0.0–3.2s): open tight on the real dungeon, then one continuous zoom-out reveals Device A and Device B together (`viewport-change`); “State, not pixels” lands in the upper-left.
Scene 2 (3.2–6.5s): on “teleports between devices,” the camera pans along the real transfer path and locks to Device B; a single blue connector draws behind it (`svg-path-draw`).
Scene 3 (6.5–8.9s): as “Possession isn't enough” is spoken, dive to the inventory-forgery refusal (`coordinate-target-zoom`) and reveal `ITEM ✕`.
Scene 4 (8.9–11.221s): cut-the-curve to the parent-provenance refusal, reveal `PARENT ✕`, then hold “LAST GOOD HEAD PRESERVED” beside the real receipt.

narrativeRole: Turn portability into an intuitive game-world demonstration while keeping provenance central.
keyMessage: Portable state must carry a valid history.

## Selected blueprint: camera-journey

# camera-journey — Camera Journey

**intent**: The real viewport camera is the STORYTELLER — a multi-leg journey (dive in → a mid-journey beat fires → travel to the consequence / reposition → landing push, at rest) across ONE continuous world, where the travel itself carries the narrative. Two folded sub-shapes: **(A) action roundtrip** — the camera dives into a UI panel, a cursor/typed action fires, and the camera swoops/pans to another region where the consequence renders as element motion; **(B) cursorless flight** — pure cinematic 3D flight (motion blur, depth-of-field, tilt-to-flatten rotations) over static or self-animating content, no cursor anywhere.

**boundary**: This is NOT `cursor-ui-demo` — there the camera _chases_ the cursor (a servo following the actor); here the camera IS the actor, moving on its own narrative motivation, and in sub-shape A the cursor acts only at the leg hinge (in B it never appears). This is NOT `device-surface-showcase` — there one DEVICE/surface is hero and the camera merely presents it; here no single surface is hero — the journey traverses multiple regions/panels/depth planes and the traversal is the story. This is NOT `spatial-pan-stations` — there pre-placed stations on a flat canvas are visited by repeated pans of the same type; here the legs are heterogeneous (push-in, swoop, pull-back-rotate, whip, dive) and each leg is _motivated_ (by a fired action, or by the reveal it lands on).

**roles served**

- Benefits (from `camera-swoop-panel-action-roundtrip`): when the benefit IS a cause→effect round trip — "do this small thing here, get this big thing there" (comment → chart morphs; agent finding → verified commit; chat message → receipt + ledger). The camera physically connects the action to its payoff, so the viewer _travels_ the value chain instead of being told it.
- Key_Feature (from `cursorless-camera-flight`): when the feature should feel cinematic and inevitable — a payout form or a generated content-plan calendar explored by a flying camera (dives, whip sweeps, tilt-to-flatten, violent final push onto the CTA/hero card), the content acting by itself (a dropdown self-selects; keyword cards simply exist in depth) with no hand on the wheel.

**duration**: 5.6–11.1s (sub-shape A 5.6–9.0s: 001 5.6s · 066 8.6s · 004 9.0s; sub-shape B 6.3–11.1s: Outrank 6.3s · 094 11.1s)

**shot structure** (one oversized `[world]` — a `[UI canvas: design tool / GitHub + agent panels / phone + desktop ledger]` (A) or a `[3D-laid-out space: floating form card / calendar grid with standing keyword cards]` (B) — wrapped by a single virtual camera; content animates as elements _inside_ the world while the camera travels; every leg is a sequential tween on the same camera state)

- **Scene 0 (optional, 0.0–~1.8s) — static prologue.** Camera locked on a `[prologue beat: static promo card with a floating 3D product card / typed headline with an accent word / wide establishing shot of the app]`. A typewriter line may finish (`[headline]` types on, accent word in `[accent color]`). The prologue BREAKS by a hard cut or by the headline shrinking and slipping away as the first dive begins — the stillness exists to make the journey's launch land.

- **Scene 1 (~0.5–2.0s) — LEG 1: dive in.** The camera pushes in FAST and TIGHT onto `[the focal element]`:
  - _Sub-shape A_: a flat whole-viewport push onto `[an actionable element: comment box / agent panel / chat bubble]` where `[typed text]` finishes typing or `[response text]` streams in. The header/context leaves the frame — commitment, not a polite zoom.
  - _Sub-shape B_: the push lands at an ANGLE — a tilted 3D close-up of `[the form region / the calendar grid]`, foreground elements motion-blurred during the travel, neighbors soft under depth-of-field. A huge `[foreground prop: date number / field label]` may dominate the frame, blurred by speed.

- **Scene 2 (~1.5–6.0s) — LEG 2: the mid-journey beat (the hinge).** The camera holds, drifts, or pulls slowly while the content ACTS:
  - _Sub-shape A — the action fires_: a `[cursor]` clicks `[Send / Create PR]` (or a `[message]` sends implicitly) and the acted element CLEARS/vanishes. Optional theater before the click: a `[status spinner]` cycles `[status words]`, `[to-do items]` strike through, `[response text]` streams. The click is the hinge that _motivates_ the next leg.
  - _Sub-shape B — the content self-acts_: a `[dropdown]` expands by itself (pushing `[the field below]` down), shows a `[row hover highlight]` with no cursor, and collapses with the new value selected; OR the flight decelerates INTO FOCUS on `[one card]` — its `[metrics]` sharp, neighboring cards blurred.

- **Scene 3 (~4.0–8.0s) — LEG 3: travel to the consequence / reposition.**
  - _Sub-shape A_: the camera pulls back / swoops / pans to `[region B]` while the CONSEQUENCE builds as element motion — `[bars shrink into the baseline while a node-dotted line draws left→right / a verified commit row slides into the timeline + a reaction pill pops / a receipt card expands row-by-row from a skeleton]`. An optional SECOND leg extends the trip: `[pan up-right to a toolbar → a dropdown cascades open / match cut into an extreme close-up → a fast decelerating zoom-out reveals a ledger table]`.
  - _Sub-shape B_: a repositioning move — a slow pull-back that ROTATES the world flat and centered (3D → straight-on 2D), or a heavily motion-blurred WHIP SWEEP that resolves into a flat lateral pan across `[a month calendar / the full card]`. On the flat hold, quiet element beats may play: a thin `[focus outline]` fades in around one `[field]` and sweeps down to the next; the card keeps a near-imperceptible tilt/scale drift so the hold never dies.

- **Scene 4 (final ~1–2s) — LEG 4: landing.** The journey resolves on the payoff:
  - _Sub-shape A_: the camera comes to REST; the `[cursor]` hovers or drifts toward `[the payoff: an open Export menu item / the commit link / the View-transaction button]`; ends still, on the changed state — the world is visibly different from where the trip began.
  - _Sub-shape B_: a sudden VIOLENT push-in/dive (motion-blurred) onto `[the CTA button scaled huge in frame / the hero keyword card]`, ending holding tight — or holding MID-DIVE (the last frames are still traveling; the flat overview is explicitly not the final image).

**motion vocabulary**: whole-viewport camera push-in (fast/tight and slow/subtle); camera pull-back reframe; camera pan up/right/down; dive/swoop between stacked panels; fast decelerating zoom-out to rest; sudden violent push-in onto a button scaled huge; continuous 3D flight through a card grid; dive into an angled 3D close-up; slow pull-back that rotates/flattens the world to straight-on; heavily motion-blurred whip sweep; motion blur on camera travel; depth-of-field with blurred neighbors; decelerate-into-focus; hard cut / match cut into extreme close-up; near-imperceptible tilt/scale drift on holds; typed text finishing in an input; typewriter headline; headline shrinks and slips away as the camera dives; streaming AI response text; status-word spinner cycling labels; to-do strikethrough draw; cursor click; clicked element clears/vanishes; dropdown cascades open / self-expands and collapses with a row hover highlight (displacing the field below); bar-to-line chart morph (bars shrink into the baseline while a node-dotted line draws left→right, labels persist); commit row slide-in on a timeline; reaction pill appears; skeleton→content card build; receipt/label rows expand row-by-row; thin focus outline fades in and sweeps between fields; camera drift toward a button; 3D card subtle float; cursor hover at rest.

**rule mapping**

- the multi-leg camera itself — sequential push / pull-back / pan / dive phases on one wrapper, plus the micro-drift that keeps holds alive → `multi-phase-camera` (phase sequencing + drift) over `viewport-change` (the base virtual-camera primitive: single `.world` wrapper, one `cam {scale,x,y}` state — one source of truth for every leg)
- diving TIGHT onto an off-center element (comment box, chat bubble, Send button, one keyword card) → `coordinate-target-zoom` (scale + counter-translate; measure the target, don't hand-derive — a journey amplifies centering error on every leg)
- fast decelerating zoom-out from an extreme close-up to rest (066's ledger reveal) → `coordinate-target-zoom` zoom-out variation / `multi-phase-camera` (pull phase, hard `power4.out`)
- motion blur on camera travel (dive, whip sweep, violent final push) → `motion-blur-streak` (Camera-travel carve-out — the blur envelope rides the `.world` wrapper during a leg: the world never leaves frame, the blur peaks at peak velocity and resolves sharp at each landing)
- depth-of-field on neighbors while one card is in focus; decelerate-into-focus → `depth-of-field-blur` (focal pull + blur-the-cluster-while-pushing-in are explicitly in scope; run the DoF tween at the same position as the camera leg)
- the 3D flight itself (sub-shape B's core) — a perspective camera traveling with `rotateX/rotateY/translateZ` through a 3D-laid-out world: the dive into an angled calendar grid, the tilt-to-flatten pull-back (angled 3D → straight-on 2D), the continuous flight between standing cards → `3d-camera-flight` (perspective wrapper + preserve-3d; the 2D camera rules keep owning any flat legs)
- whip sweep → composition: `nudge-curve` (burst-dominant tuning of the slow-fast-slow slide, applied to the world) + `motion-blur-streak` (camera-travel carve-out) on the same window
- typed text finishing in an input; typewriter headline; streaming AI response text; status spinner cycling `[status words]`; skeleton→content state swap → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `gsap-effects` typewriter; `context-sensitive-cursor` for the input caret)
- which content appears per leg / receipt rows and findings arriving on script windows → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- cursor click on `[Send / Create PR]` (sub-shape A's hinge) → `cursor-click-ripple` + `press-release-spring` (or `physics-press-reaction` for a weightier press)
- clicked element clears/vanishes; panel state A → B on the return leg → `scale-swap-transition` / `card-morph-anchor`
- to-do strikethrough draw; row hover highlight → `css-marker-patterns` (strike-through) · `asr-keyword-glow` (accent glow on the hovered/selected row)
- bar-to-line chart morph → composite, decomposes cleanly: `stat-bars-and-fills` (bars `scaleY` → baseline) + `svg-path-draw` (node-dotted line draws left→right) at the same timeline position — no single rule names the coordinated chart-type morph, but no new rule needed
- commit row slide-in; reaction pill appears; receipt rows expand row-by-row → `spring-pop-entrance` (single arrivals) / `waterfall-entry` (the row-by-row cascade)
- dropdown self-expands, displacing the field below (094) → `anchored-layout-expand` (the masked edge-anchored expansion of the dropdown body — never tween `height`) + `reactive-displacement` (the expansion tween drives the sibling's displacement)
- focus-ring travel between fields (094: a thin outline fades in on `From`, then sweeps down onto `Amount`) → `ai-tracking-box` restyled as a plain outline (offsets baked at setup; size morphed via scale, never width/height)
- 3D card subtle float; near-imperceptible tilt/scale drift on holds → `sine-wave-loop` (+ `multi-phase-camera`'s drift for the camera-side micro-motion; the _tilt_ component of the drift belongs to `3d-camera-flight`)
- camera drift toward a button; slow subtle zoom-ins riding a hold → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push mode, tiny spread)

**camera grammar** (the defining layer — this blueprint IS its camera): every leg is a tween on ONE camera state (`viewport-change`'s single `.world` wrapper / `cam` object), sequenced by `multi-phase-camera`, aimed by `coordinate-target-zoom`. Legs must be _motivated_: sub-shape A moves because an action fired (click → swoop to the consequence); sub-shape B moves because the next reveal demands it (dive → focus → reposition → final dive). Vary the leg verbs — a journey of four identical pushes reads as a slideshow. Ease law: hard `out`-family on dives and landings (`power4.out` — violent arrival, sharp settle), `power2.inOut` on repositioning legs; spring/back easing on a camera feels wrong (per `multi-phase-camera`). Sub-shape B layers `3d-camera-flight`'s perspective wrapper under the same single-state discipline.

**Seek-safety (non-negotiable for this much camera):** the entire journey — every leg, every blur envelope, every DoF pull — lives on the ONE paused GSAP timeline, so any frame seek reproduces the exact mid-leg camera pose. One camera state object, transform composed in a single writer (`applyCamera()`), no CSS `transition` anywhere near the wrapper, blur via proxy-tweened attributes / `--dof` vars (both seek-safe), and ending mid-dive is fine — a seek to the last frame just lands mid-tween. Per-leg targets are measured ONCE at setup (after `fonts.ready`) and baked; never `getBoundingClientRect` in `onUpdate`.

**Overflow (required for a clean `check`):** a traveling camera deliberately moves world content past the frame edges on every leg. Keep `overflow: hidden` on the scene root AND mark the moving `.world` wrapper with `data-layout-allow-overflow` — otherwise `check` reports `text_box_overflow` / `container_overflow` for every panel the journey leaves behind (see the same note on `device-surface-showcase`).

# Coordinate Target Zoom

A simple `scale > 1` on a wrapper pushes off-center content OFF the visible canvas. To zoom _into_ a specific non-centered element, apply scale AND an inverse translation in lockstep so the target lands at viewport center.

## How It Works

Two nested wrappers, separated concerns — never scale and translate on the SAME element (`translate * scale` ≠ `scale * translate` in CSS transform composition):

1. **Outer wrapper** applies `scale` (the zoom) around `transform-origin: 50% 50%`
2. **Inner wrapper** applies `translate(x, y)` (the counter-shift)

The counter-translate is the **negation** of the target's offset from viewport center:

```
T = -offset
```

Derivation: the inner translate moves the target to `offset + T` in pre-scale units; the outer scale S (around center) maps that to `S × (offset + T)`; landing at center means `S × (offset + T) = 0` → **`T = -offset`**. The formula does NOT depend on S — the translate is identical at 1.5×, 2×, or 3×. A common wrong intuition is `T = -offset × (S - 1)`: it coincidentally matches at S = 2 and is wrong at every other scale.

⚠️ **This is the NESTED-wrapper formula.** The single-wrapper camera in [viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md) puts `translate(x,y) scale(S)` on ONE element, where CSS applies scale first — there the counter-translate is **`T = -offset × S`**. The two formulas are not interchangeable; match the formula to the wrapper structure.

## Getting the offset

`T = -offset` is only as good as `offset`. The #1 way this pattern ships broken is hand-computing `offset` from a layout formula, getting the **sign** or magnitude wrong, and letting the zoom amplify a small error off-screen. **Default to measuring the target's real laid-out center; reserve the formula for symmetric rows.**

**Default — measure the actual center (works for ANY layout).** Immune to sign errors because it reads the rendered DOM, not a mental model:

```js
await document.fonts.ready; // metrics final; fallback fonts are 10–30px off → tens of px after a 3×+ zoom
const W = 1920,
  H = 1080;
const r = document.getElementById("target-card").getBoundingClientRect();
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = r.left + r.width / 2 - W / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_Y = r.top + r.height / 2 - H / 2;
```

Measure **once at setup** and bake — never per-frame in `onUpdate`. Because the measurement is async (`fonts.ready`), build and register the timeline inside the same `async` setup so the baked offset is ready before `window.__timelines[id]` is published.

**Shortcut — symmetric equal-width row ONLY:**

```js
const index_offset = targetIndex - (N - 1) / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = index_offset * (CARD_WIDTH + CARD_GAP);
```

⚠️ This assumes every sibling is the **same width**. The moment the row is asymmetric, it gives the wrong answer — often the wrong **sign**: the heavier side shifts the centered target the _opposite_ way you'd guess (e.g. `companion(220) + gap + wordmark + gap + chip(110)` puts the wordmark ~55px **right** of center, but "chip − companion" intuition says left). For anything but equal cards, **measure**.

**Headroom budget — cap the scale from the measured size.** A zoom multiplies any centering error; keep the target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak:

```js
const maxScale = Math.min((0.88 * W) / r.width, (0.88 * H) / r.height);
const ZOOM_SCALE = Math.min(DESIRED_SCALE, maxScale);
```

A target filling 97%+ of the frame reads as cut-off the instant its center is slightly off — and a hand-baked offset always is. (The perception gate flags this as `primary-offscreen`; `data-layout-allow-overflow` does **not** exempt it.)

## Recipe

```html
<div class="zoom-outer" id="zoom-outer">
  <div class="zoom-inner" id="zoom-inner">
    <div class="content">
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
      <div class="card target" id="target-card">{target}</div>
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — at zoom > 1 the scaled content leaks past the frame */
}
.zoom-outer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* center scaling is what the counter-translate math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
.zoom-inner {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
// TARGET_OFFSET_X/Y and ZOOM_SCALE come from "Getting the offset" — measured
// at setup (after fonts.ready), baked. Counter-translation = -offset.
const counterX = -TARGET_OFFSET_X;
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y;

// Scale and counter-translate MUST share position, duration, AND ease —
// otherwise the target visibly wanders mid-zoom.
tl.to("#zoom-outer", { scale: ZOOM_SCALE, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" }, ZOOM_AT);
tl.to(
  "#zoom-inner",
  { x: counterX, y: counterY, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" },
  ZOOM_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Zoom out (target → wide view)**: reverse the phases — start zoomed-in, then tween to `scale: 1` + `x: 0, y: 0`; the "reveal" beat is the panorama.
- **Multi-target zoom sequence**: chain zooms (target A → pause → target B → pull back); each segment needs its own counter-translation pair.

## Values

| ZOOM_DUR   | 1.0–2.0s                                | under 0.8s feels like a teleport, over 2.5s drags; both tweens share it                    |
| ZOOM_AT    | after the layout lands + 0.5–1.5s       | give the viewer time to scan the layout before the camera commits                          |
| DWELL      | ≥ 1.0s after the zoom settles           | 1.5–2s ideal — the viewer must be able to read the target (climax dwell)                   |

## Critical Constraints

- **Outer scales, inner translates** — never both transforms on one element; nested wrappers keep the math clean.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on the outer wrapper** — non-center origin breaks the counter-translate derivation.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the scene root** — zoomed content leaks past the frame otherwise.
- **Scale and counter-translate share duration + ease** at the same timeline position, or the target drifts mid-zoom.
- **Offset measured once at setup** (after `fonts.ready`), baked — never recomputed per-frame, never hand-derived for a non-symmetric layout (wrong sign → target shoved off-frame).
- **Scale within the headroom budget** — target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak, derived from the measured size.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="world" id="world">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="hero">{Brand}</div>
    <div class="tagline">{tagline}</div>
    <div class="cta" id="cta">{ctaUrl}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any non-1.0 scale reveals edges or pushes content off-frame */
  background: {bgGradient}; /* on .scene, NOT .world — a world-borne background warps with the camera */
}
.world {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* centered scaling is what the math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
const world = document.getElementById("world");

// Camera state — single source of truth. The world transform is composed from
// this object in ONE place so the transform string order is stable.
const cam = { scale: 1, x: 0, y: 0 };
function applyCamera() {
  world.style.transform = `translate(${cam.x}px, ${cam.y}px) scale(${cam.scale})`;
}
applyCamera(); // seed frame 0

// Zoom in on the CTA: single-element composite transform → T = -offset × S.
// TARGET_OFFSET_Y is the target's measured offset from viewport center at
// neutral camera (sign matters — positive = below center).
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y * TARGET_SCALE;

tl.to(
  cam,
  {
    scale: TARGET_SCALE,
    y: counterY,
    duration: ZOOM_DUR,
    ease: "power3.inOut",
    onUpdate: applyCamera,
  },
  ZOOM_START,
);
```

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
