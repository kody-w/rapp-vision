## Frame 6 — Preserve the disagreement

- scene: Space-station footage holds as two airlock alternatives remain visible; overwrite rejection becomes the editorial proof card.
- voiceover: "Six agents build one station without flattening disagreement. Two airlock pressures survive in parallel; an overwrite that erases one is refused."

- sfx: whoosh-short, error

Adapt: keep the held hero surface; cycle through real build, conflict, and rejection ranges while the editorial layer translates each into a benefit.
Scene 1 (0.0–3.0s): the real station build occupies a large left window; `6 AGENTS` and `1 STATION` reveal in sequence on the right, using value-scaled counters (`counting-dynamic-scale`) without invented metrics.
Scene 2 (3.0–6.8s): on “without flattening disagreement,” cut to the real 68 and 72 kilopascal alternatives; both values draw as equal parallel rails (`svg-path-draw`) and neither is visually subordinated.
Scene 3 (6.8–9.3s): as “an overwrite that erases one” lands, zoom to the overwrite candidate and press the blue rejection label (`press-release-spring`) beside the live proof.
Scene 4 (9.3–10.112s): hold `5 / 6 FIDELITY` and `BOTH ALTERNATIVES PRESERVED` as a calm technical receipt.

narrativeRole: Show that fidelity means retaining justified alternatives rather than forcing false consensus.
keyMessage: Conflicts can remain explicit without stopping the system.

## Selected blueprint: device-surface-showcase

# device-surface-showcase — Device / Surface Showcase

**intent**: A product surface — a device mockup or a floating browser/app window — is the hero held in frame while its screens cycle through a real flow, showcased by a camera move that ranges from a static hold to a continuous 3D push.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from key-feature-device-screen-tour, key-feature-floating-window-scroll, key-feature-3d-device-hand-demo): show a feature being \_experienced inside its real interface\* — the surface houses the action and its screens advance through a flow, rather than enumerating tiles or chasing a cursor across a workflow. (Note: the three founding drafts are Key_Feature and variants differ by MECHANIC, not role; the mined stepwise-flow variant widens the blueprint to Product_Intro.)
- Key_Feature (from demo-page-scroll-spotlight): the floating-window push-scroll variant carried to a spotlight climax — a real webpage rendered as a tilted 3D card coasts in (power2, like a phone held up — no spring), header keywords flare on a karaoke glow as the VO names them, the page rolls to the demoed section, and one element LIFTS off the surface (translateZ + scale) under a radial spotlight that dims the rest.
- Product_Intro (from stepwise-flow-completion): a compact end-to-end product flow — setup/auth → action → success/confirm — plays out cursorless as successive screen states inside the held surface, capped by a confirming button press; bookended by title-card beats. The surface introduces the product by \_completing its core loop\*, not by touring screens.
- Key_Feature (from `showcase-carousel`): the showcase-carousel — two surfaces in sequence (a widget card cycling brand skins, a phone frame with app screens sliding through it) gated by interstitial claim words; the screen cycle is a breadth carousel ("N brands / N apps"), not a flow.

**duration**: 5–11.3s (page-scroll-spotlight 5–9s · floating-window 7.8s · 3d-hand 7.9s · in-device approval 7.9s · stepwise-flow 8.5–9.4s · device-tour 9.6s · showcase-carousel 11.3s)

**shot structure** One product surface — a `[device mockup]` or a `[floating browser/app window]` — is the persistent hero on a `[styled backdrop: gradient / radial / stylized 3D void]`; its `[screens/sections]` cycle through a real `[product flow]` while a showcase camera (static-hold, push-in→zoom-out, or one continuous push) presents it. Each screen state holds ~1.0–1.5s.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s): The surface ESTABLISHES — it `[slides in from an edge / drifts in from a tilt / dissolves from a full-frame title card]` and settles, with a `[accent shape or backdrop]` resolving behind it; the first `[screen]` is visible. The showcase camera begins (see variants).
- Scene 2 (~1.5–~Xs): The surface is OPERATED on its own face — a `[tap/select/scroll]` triggers the first screen advance: old content `[pushes out / scrolls up]`, new `[screen/section]` `[pulls up / pushes in from the side]`; concurrently a `[label / header word / side headline]` updates. The camera continues its move.
- Scene 3+ (~Xs–end, repeat for `[2–4 screen beats]`): The surface ADVANCES through successive `[screens/sections]`, each a discrete swap or scroll synced to the surface's flow, while the secondary copy `[swaps out-up / in-up]` or stays marked to hold reading position. HOLDS on the final `[screen]` (or, for one variant, blooms out — see variant).

- Variant — static-tour (key-feature-device-screen-tour, 9.6s): a `[device mockup]` slides in from off-screen and settles (ease-out); an `[accent-color shape]` scales up behind it (spring overshoot). Camera STAYS STATIC the entire clip — all motion is element/UI-level: a tap COMPRESSES a button (95%→100%), the UI scrolls/transitions to the next view (old pushes out, new pulls up), and a `[side headline]` SWAPS beside the device (old slides up + fades, new slides up + in) per screen. Holds on the final screen. No camera move, no cursor.
- Variant — floating-window (key-feature-floating-window-scroll, 7.8s): OPENS on a full-frame `[title card]` (a small `[icon]` draws in at center, `[feature name]` below; holds ~2s), which DISSOLVES to a `[macOS-style browser/app window]` floating on a `[vivid gradient]` (traffic-lights + `[URL pill]` + tabs; left nav, central content, right `[sidebar]`). Camera PUSHES IN on a `[target region/sidebar]` (active item highlighted `[accent]`, a cursor drifts down the list), then ZOOMS BACK OUT to re-frame the whole window while the content SCROLLS through `[sections]`; the `[highlighted item]` stays marked. One push-in→zoom-out arc, gated by the title-card opener.
- Variant — 3d-hand (key-feature-3d-device-hand-demo, 7.9s): FULLY 3D — a `[3D device]` drifts in a `[stylized 3D void / bloom + particles]`, opening tilted and self-rotating to face the lens nearly flat as ONE CONTINUOUS forward camera push begins (no cuts). A glossy `[3D hand]` rises from the bottom-foreground and GESTURE-DRIVES the surface: it swipes to scroll a `[picker/sidebar panel]` of `[option cards]` and taps `[option]` (while a `[header word]` letter-flips in place); the selection APPLIES — a `[new layout]` grows from center to fill the device face, nav flips, a `[marquee]` scrolls horizontally; the hand swipes again to scroll the page upward through `[sections]`, then drifts out. The camera never stops pushing; the bright device face keeps growing toward the lens until it BLOOMS into a `[light]` wash — a zoom-through "portal" exit that fills the frame.
- Variant — stepwise-flow (Product_Intro, 8.5–9.4s; in-device Key_Feature sub-mode 7.9s): CURSORLESS end-to-end flow — the surface completes `[setup/auth → action → success]` as a narrative arc. Opens on a `[title card]` that fades in/out on an ambient gradient (or a typed `[command]` running character-by-character on a terminal field). The `[flow surface]` arrives (phone mock slides up oversized and settles / bordered log panel replaces the command) and step 1 completes via rapid sequential pops — `[OTP digits]` fill boxes left-to-right capped by a green check, or `[log steps]` pop top-down with highlighted tokens, ending on a trailing-dots waiting state. State advances laterally (old content slides out left, new in from right, chrome persists) or via a dark-to-light scene swap into a white `[detail/confirm card]` whose elements stagger in. COMMIT: the `[CTA button]` is pressed (press dip / spinner "Processing") and a `[success state]` renders with check bullets — in the in-device sub-mode the commit runs a biometric ritual: dim overlay, `[squircle]` spring-pops, a ring draws around an icon, the icon morphs to a checkmark and holds; a slight camera push-in fires ONLY at the state transition (camera punctuates the commit, then re-locks). EXIT: the surface leaves and closing `[title cards]` pop in and ease smaller — the surface exits before the coda instead of holding. Camera otherwise static. For this variant the persistent hero is the FLOW, not one surface: a terminal panel may hand off wholesale to a confirm card.
- Variant — showcase-carousel (Key_Feature, 11.3s): TWO surfaces in sequence on a slowly drifting `[pastel mesh gradient]`, static camera, gated by centered interstitial `[claim words]` (fade in with gentle scale-up, fade out). Act 1: a white `[widget card]` scales in, flips/morphs into a tilted vertical widget and CYCLES `[N brand skins]` (~0.8s each) — one shared layout, per-skin content and accent swaps — while a large `[brand logo]` crossfades below per flip; the widget scales away. Act 2: a `[phone frame]` enters oversized and tilted, settles upright at center; full `[app screens]` slide left through it (~1s each), holding on the last. The screen cycle is a breadth carousel, not a flow — no taps, no cursor, no camera.

**motion vocabulary** surface establish (edge slide-in + settle / tilt drift-in + self-rotate-to-camera / title-card dissolve); accent shape spring behind surface; element-level screen-cycling (scroll-swap, push-in-from-side, scale-swap); button tap-compress; staggered side-headline reveal + copy swap (out-up / in-up); in-place header-word letter-flip; floating browser-window-on-gradient idle float; full-frame title-card opener (icon draw-in + label); camera push-IN on a region; camera zoom-OUT re-frame; content scroll-through; one continuous 3D camera-follow push (no cuts); 3D device drift + self-rotate; stylized-environment bloom/particles; 3D-hand entrance + swipe-scroll + tap (gesture-driven); picker-panel slide-in; template-apply grow-from-center; horizontal marquee scroll; gesture-driven page scroll; zoom-through bloom/portal exit; static-hold (no camera) as the floor of the camera range. Stepwise-flow additions: title-card bookends (fade-in/out opener; closers pop in then ease smaller); typed terminal command with prompt chevron; sequential top-down log pops with sub-line reveals; animated trailing-dots wait state; sequential digit pops left-to-right + green check confirm; lateral screen slide with persistent chrome; dark-to-light scene swap; staggered card element build-in (fade + slide-up); button press dip + fill flip; spinner processing state; success check-bullet reveal; notification banner spring-in with overshoot; lockscreen fade/blur-away as a card expands to fill the device face; commit-synced micro push-in; dim overlay; squircle spring pop; circular ring draw; icon morph to checkmark; surface exit before a title coda. Showcase-carousel additions: interstitial claim-word gate; brand-skin cycling with per-flip logo crossfade; card flip/morph into a tilted widget; oversized-tilted surface entry settling upright; fast slide-left screen carousel inside a static frame; drifting mesh-gradient backdrop.

**rule mapping** (per motion verb → backing rule, or flagged special)

- screen-cycling — UI scrolls/sections scroll inside the surface (device-tour, floating-window scroll, 3d-hand page scroll) → `3d-page-scroll` (webpage/app as a tilted card whose content `translateY`-scrolls to sections; primary mechanic for the surface's screen flow)
- floating-window establish + the surface presented as a tilted/floating UI card → `3d-page-scroll` (the tilt/perspective framing) + `css-3d-transforms` (perspective/`translateZ` depth)
- screen / side-copy state swaps (discrete screen states; side headline content swapping per beat) → `discrete-text-sequence`
- side-headline reveal (staggered fade + slide-up) → `discrete-text-sequence`
- in-place header-word letter-flip (3d-hand) → `hacker-flip-3d`
- screen swap as a coordinated shrink-out / pop-in between two screen states → `scale-swap-transition`
- template-apply "new layout grows from center to fill the face" (3d-hand) → `center-outward-expansion` (clustered-at-center → expand to fill)
- the surface morphing between states / title-card→window dissolve as the eye-anchor transition → `card-morph-anchor`
- button tap-compress (95%→100% press feedback) → `press-release-spring` (or `physics-press-reaction` for a heavier press)
- floating-window cursor click on the highlighted list item → `cursor-click-ripple`
- accent-highlight pop on the active sidebar/list item → `asr-keyword-glow` (accent glow on the focused item)
- drifting cursor down the sidebar list (floating-window) → `camera-cursor-tracking` (flat-cursor drift; pairs with the push-in)
- floating browser-window idle float / 3D device drift-breathe → `sine-wave-loop`
- 3D device drift + self-rotate-to-camera + perspective depth (3d-hand) → `css-3d-transforms` (CSS-3D) **or** `3d.md` technique (true Three.js/R3F device); see camera modifier
- horizontal `[marquee]` scroll (3d-hand) → `viewport-change` (PAN mode on the marquee strip) — _thin fit; a literal CSS-marquee/translateX loop is closer to a `gsap-effects`/CSS recipe than a named motion rule_
- 3D-hand entrance + swipe + tap as the interaction DRIVER (gesture input that scrolls/selects) → **flagged special — needs a heavier capability beyond the rule library (R3F/Three.js + WebGL), NOT a motion-shape rule.** The 3D hand model + WebGL bloom have a _technique_ backing (`3d.md` — R3F, `useGLTF` HandModel, `--gl=swiftshader` for the shader/bloom), but no motion-shape rule models a 3D hand as the swipe-to-scroll / tap-to-select gesture protocol. `context-sensitive-cursor` / `camera-cursor-tracking` only model a flat typing/pointer cursor, not a 3D gesturing hand.
- zoom-through bloom / portal exit (3d-hand) → **flagged special — needs a heavier capability beyond the rule library (WebGL), NOT a named transition rule.** Capability is `techniques.md` → WebGL shader (via `3d.md` headless WebGL: `--gl=swiftshader --concurrency=1`), but no named transition rule covers a bloom/portal fly-through.
- typed terminal command / non-linear log text (stepwise-flow) → `discrete-text-sequence` (typing + threshold state replacement) with `dynamic-content-sequencing` computing each step's window from content length
- sequential top-down log pops / OTP digit pops left-to-right / staggered confirm-card build-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group form; low overshoot for log lines)
- trailing-dots wait state → `sine-wave-loop` (finite repeats; step the opacity of 3 dots on a shared phase)
- lateral screen slide with persistent chrome → the existing screen-cycling mapping (`3d-page-scroll` translateX form inside the clipped surface); chrome sits outside the sliding layer
- notification banner spring-in / squircle pop (in-device) → `spring-pop-entrance`
- lockscreen fade/blur-away + card expands to fill the device face → `card-morph-anchor` (uniform-scale container morph — never tween width/height) + `depth-of-field-blur` (the blur-away)
- commit-synced micro push-in (camera punctuates the Approve/tap, then re-locks) → `multi-phase-camera` (single short push phase placed at the state transition)
- button press dip + fill flip / Approve press-down spring-back → `press-release-spring` (already mapped; the fill flip is its color-transition variation)
- spinner processing state → `svg-icon-enrichment` (rotating internal element with explicit SVG center)
- success check bullets / biometric ring draw → `svg-path-draw` (check strokes; ring rotated −90° to start at 12 o'clock) + `spring-pop-entrance` for the bullet pops
- icon morph to checkmark (biometric ritual) → **flagged special — SVG path morph, see hyperframes-keyframes (morph)**; no motion-shape rule models it — mechanics live in `techniques.md` / the keyframes skill, same tier as the blueprint's existing WebGL flags
- interstitial claim-word gate (fade + gentle scale-up, then out) → `gsap-effects` (plain fade/scale chord; deliberately quieter than `kinetic-beat-slam`)
- brand-skin cycling with per-flip logo crossfade → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state content replacement at thresholds) + `scale-swap-transition` where a flip reads as shrink-out/pop-in; the card→tilted-widget flip/morph → `card-morph-anchor` + `css-3d-transforms`
- drifting mesh-gradient backdrop → `sine-wave-loop` (very-low-amplitude position/hue drift on gradient blobs)

**camera modifier**: The showcase camera spans a RANGE keyed by variant, all on a single content-wrapping virtual camera (`viewport-change`):

- static-tour → NO camera move (`viewport-change` held at scale 1, or omitted); all motion is element-level. This is the floor of the range and what distinguishes the device-tour from the rest.
- floating-window → a two-phase push-in → zoom-out arc → `multi-phase-camera` (e.g. dramatic-reveal 1.1→1.0→0.95 feel): push IN on the `[sidebar/region]` via `coordinate-target-zoom` (off-center target = scale + counter-translate), then `multi-phase-camera` zooms back OUT to re-frame the whole window while content scrolls.
- 3d-hand → ONE continuous forward push (no cuts) → `multi-phase-camera` in steady-push mode (1.0→1.03→1.06… plus its sine micro-drift) layered over `css-3d-transforms`/`3d.md` so the device self-rotates-to-lens during the push; the push runs unbroken into the bloom/portal exit (exit itself is the WebGL-shader flagged special above). Across all three: `viewport-change` is the base virtual-camera primitive; `multi-phase-camera` sequences the push/zoom phases (and supplies the always-on micro-drift that keeps even the "static" tour from feeling dead); `coordinate-target-zoom` aims the push at off-center screen detail.

**Overflow (pan/scroll surfaces — required for a clean `check`):** a panned or scrolled surface deliberately moves content PAST the edges of its framing card. Clip it at the card (`overflow: hidden` on the card/window) AND mark the moving inner layer (the `.world` / surface wrapper holding the screenshot + any markers/labels) with `data-layout-allow-overflow` — otherwise `check` reports `text_box_overflow` / `container_overflow` errors for the parts that scroll off (e.g. a marker label panned off the left edge). The card clips them visually; the attribute tells the layout audit it's intentional, not a layout bug.

# Counting with Dynamic Scale

A number counts from A → B while its transform scale grows to the final size — escalating visual weight ("this is impressive") without tweening `font-size` or forcing text layout on every frame. The final font size is static CSS; only the transform changes.

## How It Works

Two synchronized tweens at the SAME timeline position with the SAME ease: (1) a proxy value rendered as text via `onUpdate` (`Math.round(...).toLocaleString()`), (2) the counter's transform `scale: START_SCALE → 1`, where `START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE`. A suffix (`%`, `×`, `+`) slides in AFTER the count lands — the number gets its own beat — and a label fades in early.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="counter-wrap">
  <span class="counter" id="counter">0</span><span class="counter-suffix">{suffix}</span>
</div>
<div class="counter-label">{label}</div>
```

```css
.counter-wrap {
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  justify-content: center;
  width: {counterContainerWidth}; /* fixed width — no layout shift as digit count changes */
}
.counter {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits keep equal width */
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: {endSize}; /* final size is static; GSAP animates scale, not font-size */
  transform-origin: center center;
}
.counter-suffix {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

```js
const counter = document.getElementById("counter");
const state = { value: 0 };
const START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE;

// Count value — onUpdate changes text only
tl.to(
  state,
  {
    value: TARGET_VALUE,
    duration: COUNT_DUR,
    ease: COUNT_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      counter.textContent = Math.round(state.value).toLocaleString();
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Visual growth — compositor transform sharing the count's timing + ease
tl.fromTo(counter, { scale: START_SCALE }, { scale: 1, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE }, 0);

// Suffix slides in AFTER the count completes
tl.to(
  ".counter-suffix",
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUFFIX_DUR, ease: `back.out(${SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  COUNT_DUR,
);

// Label fades in early
tl.from(".counter-label", { opacity: 0, y: 12, duration: LABEL_DUR, ease: "power2.out" }, LABEL_AT);
```

## Variations

- **Direct `innerText` tween (no proxy)** — GSAP can tween `innerText` directly for a number-only counter; keep the proxy form when you need locale formatting or suffix logic. The scale tween stays separate either way:

```js
tl.to(
  counter,
  { innerText: TARGET_VALUE, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE, snap: { innerText: 1 } },
  0,
);
```

- **3D depth entry** — add a `tl.from(".counter", { z: -300, ... }, 0)` push-in; requires `perspective` on `.counter-wrap` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the counter.
- **Multi-stat coordinated reveal** — 3 stats counting in parallel share the SAME ease, duration, and start position so they finish together (a chord, not an arpeggio). Each stat usually also needs a paired graphic (bar / ring / stars) — don't stop at the number; see [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md).

## Values

| token                 | range                                       | notes                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TARGET_VALUE          | 2–3 digits ideal                            | 4+ digits needs a wider container; must fit at END_SIZE without clipping      |
| START_SIZE / END_SIZE | START ≈ 40–60% of END                       | design inputs used once for START_SCALE; never tween either                   |
| COUNT_DUR             | 1.2–2.5s                                    | below ~0.8s reads as a flash — the eye must read the digits scrolling past    |
| COUNT_EASE            | `power2.out` / `power3.out` ⭐ / `expo.out` | shared by value + scale; more `.out` = more dramatic deceleration at the peak |
| SUFFIX_DUR            | 0.3–0.6s                                    | fires at `COUNT_DUR`, never during the count                                  |
| SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR  | 1.4–2.0                                     | overshoot is fine on the suffix (it's punctuation, not data)                  |
| LABEL_AT / LABEL_DUR  | AT < COUNT_DUR/2; 0.4–0.7s                  | label arrives before the count peaks                                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`tabular-nums` mandatory** + fixed-width container as belt-and-suspenders — without them digit-count transitions (9 → 10 → 100) jitter as glyph widths change.
- **Never set `fontSize` in `onUpdate`** — final type size is static CSS; only the transform changes per frame. Keep `onUpdate` O(1): set text only, no style writes or DOM creation.
- **`Math.round`, not `Math.floor`** — halfway through the final integer should already display the final value.
- **Avoid `back.out` / `elastic.out` on the counter itself** — overshoot makes the number look unstable (it's data, not decoration). Grow in place, don't bounce.
- **Label is BIG TEXT, not a page-style caption** — a tiny paragraph under a hero-size number reads as visual noise in video. Display-size, uppercase, tracked: the label is part of the headline.

## Selected motion rule: press-release-spring

name: press-release-spring
description: Tactile button press with linear compression, spring-based elastic recovery, and layered visual feedback (shadow shrink + release burst + background glow).

# Press-Release Spring Chain

Separates input (linear compression) from output (spring recovery) to create tactile feel: the overshoot is a natural byproduct of the spring config, not manually coded, with secondary motion (shadow shrink, release burst, background glow) layered on the same trigger frame. This is a **reaction on an element already resting on screen** — an arrival that springs in from nothing is [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md); add a visible cursor actor and it becomes [physics-press-reaction.md](physics-press-reaction.md).

Two phases split at the **release**:

1. **Press**: linear ease → compression (`scale: 1 → PRESS_SCALE`, shadow shrinks). Linear, not spring — the dip must read as instant/tactile, not squishy.
2. **Release**: `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` spring back to 1.0. Optional burst glow ring expands behind the button; optional environmental glow fades in.

State continuity is critical: the release tween's start value MUST equal the press tween's end value, or the spring snaps to a different position. GSAP threads this automatically when both tweens target the same property at **adjacent positions** — `RELEASE_START = PRESS_START + PRESS_DUR`; a gap or overlap breaks it.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="press-stage">
  <div class="bg-glow" id="bg-glow"></div>
  <!-- Burst sits BEHIND the button (z-index 1 vs 2), same footprint, blurred
       radial gradient, opacity 0. bg-glow is a full-stage radial at negative
       inset so it extends past the stage edges. -->
  <div class="burst" id="burst"></div>
  <button class="btn" id="btn">{buttonLabel}</button>
</div>
```

```js
// Phase 1 — press (linear compression)
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { scale: PRESS_SCALE, boxShadow: "{btnPressedShadow}", duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_START,
);

// Phase 2 — release (spring back; start scale == PRESS_SCALE by adjacency)
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  {
    scale: 1,
    boxShadow: "{btnRestShadow}",
    duration: RELEASE_DUR,
    ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})`,
  },
  RELEASE_START,
);

// Phase 3 — burst glow pops behind the button, then fades
tl.fromTo(
  "#burst",
  { scale: 1, opacity: 0 },

## Variations

- **Subtle press** (status save / muted CTA): `PRESS_SCALE` ~0.96, `BOUNCE_FACTOR` ~1.4, burst scale/opacity reduced.
- **Dramatic press** (hero CTA / "ship it"): `PRESS_SCALE` ~0.88, `BOUNCE_FACTOR` ~2.5, burst maxed.
- **Color shift during press** — darken mid-press, return on release; interpolated `backgroundColor` at the same timeline positions as the scale tweens. Same state-continuity rule.
- **State change at release** (approve / confirm) — instead of returning to the rest color, swap to `{successColor}` at `RELEASE_START` and pop a checkmark via a separate `back.out(CHECK_BOUNCE)` tween (1.4–2.0, firmer than the button's bounce — a punctuating "stamp"; pop 0.3–0.6 s) at the same position. The button is now terminal — no further presses expected.

| BG_GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY | 0.1 subtle · 0.25 default · 0.45 max       | higher washes the whole composition; fade-in 0.6–1.0 s; inset −300…−500 px at 1080p        |

Color tokens: pressed surface darker than rest; rest shadow large + diffuse, pressed small + tight (the button "sinks toward the surface"); burst gradient darker + more saturated than `{btnBg}` — same-color glow looks washed out; bg glow a low-opacity tint of the button's hue family.

## Critical Constraints

- **State continuity** — release start value exactly equals press end value; enforced by same-property adjacency at `RELEASE_START = PRESS_START + PRESS_DUR`.
- **Linear press, spring release** — both spring → squishy; both linear → mechanical, no overshoot punch.
- **Anchor compression on center** (`transform-origin: 50% 50%`) or the button collapses asymmetrically.
- **Burst behind, not in front** — burst `z-index: 1`, button `z-index: 2`; in front it occludes the button at peak opacity.
- **Don't tween `boxShadow` and `filter` on the same element** — they compete in the layout pipeline; shadow on the button, blur on the separate burst layer.
- **Climax dwell** — after the burst peak + reveal, the composition must run ≥ 1 s more (≥ 2 s for dramatic variants); a reveal at `t = DURATION − 0.2 s` reads as "flashed and gone."

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
